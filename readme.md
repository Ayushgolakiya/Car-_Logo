## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-directory
   ```
   
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the YOLO environment:
   - Follow the setup instructions provided in the `instl.ipynb` notebook.

## Usage

### Dataset Preparation

1. **Data Scraping:** Use the scripts in the `Datascraping` folder to gather images for training. These scripts scrape images of various car brands and save them into appropriate directories.
   
2. **Image Preprocessing:** The notebooks in the `Conversion_to_png` directory preprocess and convert the raw images into a format suitable for model training.

3. **Annotation:** Use the scripts in the `Upload_roboflow_to_anotate` folder to upload images to Roboflow, where they can be annotated for object detection tasks.

### Model Training

- **Training the Model:**  
  The `Yolo/yolov9_custom.ipynb` notebook is used to train the YOLOv9 model on the processed dataset. Ensure all dependencies are installed and paths to the datasets are correctly set.
  
- **Testing the Model:**  
  Use `detect.py` and related scripts in the `Yolo/yolov9` directory to test the trained models on new images or videos.

### Web Application

- **Backend:**  
  The backend scripts, located in the `Backend` directory, handle image and video uploads, preprocessing, and model inference.

- **Frontend:**  
  The frontend scripts are in the `Frontend` directory and include web pages for image upload, video processing, and results display.

- **Running the App:**
  ```bash
  # Ensure all necessary services are running and configured
  python main.py
  ```
